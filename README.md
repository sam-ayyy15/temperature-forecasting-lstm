## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements an advanced temperature forecasting system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model analyzes historical temperature data from 1901-2017 to predict future temperature trends with high accuracy.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a robust LSTM model for temperature forecasting
- Analyze historical temperature patterns and trends
- Implement multiple LSTM architectures for comparison
- Provide accurate future temperature predictions
- Create comprehensive visualizations and analysis

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains annual temperature data spanning from 1901 to 2017, including:
- Monthly temperature readings (JAN-DEC)
- Seasonal averages (JAN-FEB, MAR-MAY, JUN-SEP, OCT-DEC)
- Annual temperature averages
- 117 years of historical data

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

### LSTM Variants Implemented:
1. **Vanilla LSTM** - Single LSTM layer with dropout
2. **Bidirectional LSTM** - Processes sequences in both directions
3. **Stacked LSTM** - Multiple LSTM layers for deep learning
4. **Hybrid Model** - Combination of LSTM and GRU layers

### Best Model Configuration:
- **Architecture:** Stacked LSTM
- **Layers:** 3 LSTM layers (100, 50, 25 units)
- **Dropout:** 0.2-0.3 for regularization
- **Optimizer:** Adam with learning rate scheduling
- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 🔧 Features

### Data Preprocessing:
- Feature engineering with temperature variations
- Seasonal difference calculations
- Moving averages for trend analysis

- **Comprehensive evaluation metrics** (RMSE, MAE, R²)
- **Interactive visualizations** for trend analysis
- **Model comparison** across different architectures
- **Automated hyperparameter optimization**

## 📈 Performance Metrics

The best performing model achieves:
- **Test RMSE:** < 0.5°C
